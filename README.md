App in Github Pages: https://marcianaduran.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json

Use Plotly.js to build a dashboard with the following:
* A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Display a sample's metadata in dasboard, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
* Loop through each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object and create a text string.
* Append an html tag with that text to the #sample-metadata panel.

Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
